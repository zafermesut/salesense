E-Commerce Sales Analysis and Prediction Dashboard

## üìå Overview
This project is a comprehensive **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard** built with Python and Streamlit. It provides insightful analytics and sales predictions using advanced machine learning models like **LSTM** and **ARIMA**. The dashboard integrates features such as **RFM Analysis**, **Customer Segmentation**, **Sales Trends**, and **Product Performance Analysis** to empower decision-making for e-commerce businesses.

## üöÄ Features

### Data Analysis
- **RFM Analysis**: Analyze Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for customer segmentation.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify customer groups for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Sales Trends**: Visualize historical sales data and trends.
- **Product Performance**: Analyze individual product sales and popularity.

### Predictive Models
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Predict future sales trends based on historical data.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Model and forecast time-series data.

### Interactive Dashboard
- Built with **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface.
- Dynamic visualizations for better data interpretation.
- Customizable parameters for analysis and predictions.

### Database
- Uses **SQLite3** for data storage and management.
- Efficient querying and handling of sales data.

## üß™ Models

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series prediction.
- Captures long-term dependencies in data.

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- A statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time-series data.
- Effective for univariate data with trends and seasonality.
